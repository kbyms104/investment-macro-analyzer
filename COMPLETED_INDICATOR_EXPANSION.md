# Project Completion Report: Full Indicator Expansion

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 1. Executive Summary
Successfully expanded the Investment Analyzer to support **115+ market indicators**. 
The system now covers comprehensive categories including US Macro, Liquidity, Crypto, Commodities, and Risk metrics. 
Data reliability has been verified against live 2026 market conditions.

## 2. Key Achievements

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- **Registry System**: Implemented a scalable `registry.rs` to manage metadata for 115 indicators.
- **Multi-Source Fetcher**: Integrated FRED, Yahoo Finance, Binance, Upbit, and Alternative.me APIs.
- **Robust Scheduler**: Auto-updates stale data with rate limiting and error handling.

### 📊 New Indicator Implementation
- **Liquidity Spreads**: 
  - `Commercial Paper Spread` (Replaced TED Spread)
  - `SOFR Spread` (Modern Repo Market Stress)
  - `Net Liquidity` (Fed Balance Sheet - TGA - RRP)
- **Commodity Ratios**:
  - `Gold/Silver Ratio` (Risk Sentiment)
  - `Copper/Gold Ratio` (Economic Growth)
- **Crypto Metrics**:
  - `Kimchi Premium` (Upbit vs Binance)
  - `Fear & Greed Index` (Alternative.me)

### 🛡️ Quality Assurance
- **Audit System**: Created `tests/audit_indicators.rs` for automated health checks of all 115 indicators.
- **Unit Tests**: Verified calculation logic for Spreads and Ratios.
- **Data Validation**: Confirming 2026 market prices (Gold ~$4980, Silver ~$100) are correctly reflected.

## 3. Discontinued / Paused Items
- **TED Spread**: Removed (LIBOR ceased). Replaced by CP Spread.
- **Yield Gap**: Paused (FRED discontinued corporate PE data).
- **CNN Fear & Greed**: Paused (No official API).

## 4. Next Steps (Recommendations)
- **Visualization Update**: Enhance frontend charts to handle the wide variety of new data ranges.
- **Alert System**: Implement user alerts for specific indicator thresholds (e.g., CP Spread > 0.5%).
